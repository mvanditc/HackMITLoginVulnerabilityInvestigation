# HackMITLoginVulnerabilityInvestigation
## BUG STATUS
✅REPORTED AND RESOLVED✅
## INTRO
In this document, I will be going over a security vulnerability I discovered while signing up to compete in this year's HackMIT (2023).

## ⚠DISCLAIMER⚠
**To start off, I want to make a disclaimer that hacking into a computer system/website where you are not supposed to have access is ```ILLEGAL```, it is considered a ```criminal offence``` and can land you in ```jail``` or with a very ```hefty fine```.**

## MEAT & POTATOS
A common security vulnerablity many poorly coded websites experience is the lack of defence against brute force attacks.
```
A brute force attack is a hacking method that uses trial and error to crack passwords, login credentials, and encryption keys.
```
This happens to be one of the first methods a hacker would commonly try as it requires a little amount of effort to complete. Below, there is a video of the vulnerablilty being shown:

Disclaimer: This image shows me logging into my own personal account via brute force, the commands on the right in red are showing the multiple login attempts made by my script.
  There is more context in the vulnerabilityDemo.mp4 file found in the repo's "Investigation" folder. The reason for the censor bar is to keep my password hidden so you can't see it.



As shown by the picture above, the HackMIT's website doesn't do much to stop an attacker from trying to log in multiple times using methods of brute force. If the website administrator is not paying attention, much of these actions can go unnoticed, posing a highly dangerous security risk.

## HOW DO I FIX THIS??

Luckily, patching this vulnerability isn't too much work. Before I tell you different ways you can fix this, I should mention that there may be more undiscovered vulnerabilities that put HackMIT's website at risk when it comes to security. It is important to always follow secure coding practices, as dumb little mistakes can lead to catastrophy.

1. The first method of fixing this is by simply adding a limit on how many times a user can login. For example, if the user attempts to log in more than 5 times, a 5 minutes cool down can be pinned onto that user's specific IP address. To avoid issues, you should try to narrow it down to the specific device. This allows people on public networks to login even though someone down the hall might be brute forcing the same website while using the same wifi.
2. You can add CAPTCHAs to the log in process, this stands for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart". As the name implies, this is basically a little quiz you can add to the login page that requires a user to complete each time they try to log in. CAPTCHAs are specifically designed to keep bots and webdrivers out of specific parts in a website.
3. Another method is by setting time delays between each login attempt. Since brute force attacks often take millions of tries, adding even a 1 second delay can significantly reduce your chances of getting breached, unless this hacker has millions of seconds to spare; which is often times not the case. I would recommend atleast 4 seconds, just to be safe.
4. Another method is by making to user answer security questions like: "Name of pet?", "Name of Grandma", "Place of birth?"
5. The final method worth mentioning for this case would be enabling or requiring two-factor authentication. However for this website, the two-factor authentication method might be overkill when it comes to stopping brute force attacks.

An extra security measure which may be worth taking is adding some sort of suspicious activity warnings. These are warnings that are sent to the site administrator if something fishy is going on. This is also a good way of finding other vulnerabilities that may be unpatched on the HackMIT website.

## HOW DOES BRUTE FORCE WORK?
If you would like to see what a real brute force attack looks like, please refer to "Investigation\bruteForceDemo.mp4", DISCLAIMER: This attack was simulated on a personal website I made/own, so nobody's website was harmed.

Since information is so widely available on internet, guessing usernames and passwords is actually not too grueling of a task, given that the website being attacked is poorly secured. Using common sense, I was able to generate a full list of possible student emails with a variety of universities (6 to be exact). Finding the email domains for these universities also only took a couple of google searches, this website allows you to find which emails are used by which organizations: https://www.neverbounce.com/company/. Using this website, I was able to find what students used for student emails. I was also able to find a list of common last names simply by googling "common last names list txt file". Using the same idea, I was also able to find a list of the most common passwords.

So far, the arsenal consists of:

- A list of university email domains
- A list of common last names
- A list of commonly used passwords

Using these lists, I was able to replicate the common naming convention used by universities when naming student emails. Using only 500 last names, I generated over 5,000,000 possible usernames. All that is left to do is to create a program that can connect to a website and login numerous times automatically.

I won't go into the details of each step I took to make these scripts, so if you are interested, please checkout the repo and take a look.
